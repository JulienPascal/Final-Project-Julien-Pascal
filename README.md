## Final-Project-Julien-Pascal

This repository contains a replication of the Paper from Jean Marc Robin (2011) "On the Dynamics of Unemployment and Wage Distribution" Econometrica, 79: 1327–1355. doi: 10.3982/ECTA9070. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3982/ECTA9070/abstract. The structure of the code is presented in the flow chart below:

## Main elements of the model:
This is a search-and-matching model with heterogeneous agents that differ in their "ability". Firms are assumed to be identical. Search is random, and worker-firm pairs are formed only when the match surplus is positive. Productivity shocks occur according to a Markov process. Following a shock in productivity, worker-firm pairs with negative surplus are destroyed. On-the-job search is permitted, and firms can make counteroffers to retain their workers. 

Wages are endogeneously determined according to a sequential auction model: unemployed workers are offered their reservation wage, while employed workers accepting an outside are offered receive all the match surplus. 

Calibrated on the US labor market, the model is able to replicated fairly well the variation in unemployment and the volatitily in wages. It explains why low wages and high wages are more procycle than intermediate wages. 

## Stylized facts the U.S. Labor Market
This section offers a visual presentation of the facts that the model aims at explaining.

###Monthly unemployment rate 1951 - 2015

Series LNS12000000 and LNS13000000 for unemployment rate; PRS85006043 for seasonally adjusted real output in the non-farm business sector; USRECM for recession periods. Notes: The data was successively log-transformed, HP-filtered with a smoothing parameter equal to 2.5\times10^{5}, detrended and exponentiated. The shaded areas represent the NBER-defined recessions. generated by https://github.com/JulianPasc/Final-Project-Julien-Pascal/blob/master/src/Calculate_Moments.py

###Detrended wage deciles
![myimage-alt-tag](https://github.com/JulianPasc/Final-Project-Julien-Pascal/blob/master/figures/Detrended_wage_deciles.png)Source: Author's calculations based on data from Jonathan Heathcote, Fabrizio Perri, Giovanni L. Violante (2009) Series are in real terms and logged. Wage deciles exhibit a divergence trend: the spread between the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile has increased over the period covered by the sample. To capture fluctuations caused by business cycle factors only, a decile-specific linear trend was removed.

### Requirements
## Julia
Julia Version 0.5.0-dev+3438, Commit a92c7ff, x86_64-linux-gnu. Until now, the code is not compatible with Julia version 0.4. To install Julia, see http://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html. The pacakges PyPlot, Distributions, StatsFuns, JLD, HDF5, NLopt, DataFrames, Copulas are required. They can be installed using the commange Pkg.add(name_of_package), except for the last one which can be obtained using Pkg.clone("https://github.com/floswald/Copulas.jl.git")

## Python
The part that estimates the empirical moments is a Python script. The following version was used: Python 3.5.1 |Anaconda 2.4.1 (64-bit)| (default, Dec  7 2015, 11:16:01) 
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux

## Updates:
Update 0:
- Code in Matlab

Update 1:
- Version that runs with Julia
- The value function iteration for the wages is slow (slightly more than 20 mn)

Update 2, 21/02/2016:
- Include two files that perform the estimation of the parameters by the Simulated Method of Moments: "estim_params.jl" and "objective_function.jl". To estimate the parameters, run "estim_params.jl"

Update 3, 10/03/2016:
-Include two files in python in the folder "Data" that calculate interesting moments for the model:
 - calculate_turnover_BLS.py HP filters the data and calculates the moments the model intends to match
 - calculate_volatility_wages.py calculate the volatility of the wage deciles
-The data necessary for the estimations is also in the folder "Data"

Update 4, 11/03/2016:
- Added some graphs that are produced by the files calculate_turnover_BLS.py and calculate_volatility_wages.py
[files removed since update 5]

Update 5, 16/04/2016:
- Major reorganization of the repository:
  - reorganize the repository with a structure "src; test; data; figures; surpluses"
  - move the matlab version in the folder "matlab_old"
  - create a main.jl file that rationalizes the code

Update 6, 18/04/2016:
 - Separate the analysis of the economy from its simulation 
 
Update 7, 26/04/2016:
- Correct one bug concerning the variable epsilon
- The package JLD has some issues with the version of Julia I am using (0.5.0-dev). I had to change the way objects are loaded
- Modify the way the parameters are estimated: 1st step, a global minimization algorithm; 2nd step, refinement using a local minimization routine

Update 8, 27/04/2016:
- Add the possibility of estimating the parameters using a simulated annealing approach. A function coded by Michael Creel following  Goffe, William L. (1996) "SIMANN: A Global Optimization Algorithm using Simulated Annealing " Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics & Econometrics Oct96, Vol. 1 Issue 3 is used.
